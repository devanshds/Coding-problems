Q. Given the head of a linked list, we repeatedly delete consecutive sequences of nodes that sum to 0 until there are no such sequences.

After doing so, return the head of the final linked list.  You may return any such answer.


Input: head = [1,2,3,-3,4]
Output: [1,2,4]

Input: head = [3,1,2,-1,-2,4,1]
Output: [3,4,1]
